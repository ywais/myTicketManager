# Final 1/5 - Tickets Manager

## Backend Requirements

- [x] The Express app should be located in the path `server/app.js` and export the `app` object (`module.exports = app;`).
- [x] The server should run on port `8080` serve the react app on `http://localhost:8080/` and expose those API endpoints:
- [x] [GET] api/tickets - returns an array of tickets from saved in `server/data.json`. If called with query param `searchText` the API will filter only tickets that have a title including a case-insensitive version of the `searchText` param

## Requirements Client

- [x] The app title should be `Tickets Manager` with a custom favicon.
- [x] The app should load (from backend) and show all Tickets.
- [x] The Ticket component should have className `ticket`.
- [x] App ticket data (received from the server) might contain `label` property (an array of strings). add those tags to the UI using elements having the `label` class.
- [x] The app should have input with id `searchInput`. This input should request the server on `onChange` with relevant `searchText` param and update the list accordingly.
- [x] Add a hide button with className `hideTicketButton` that will hide the tickets from view. Add a counter of number of hiding tickets, this counter should have a `hideTicketsCounter` className.
- [x] Add a button to restore the hidden ticket list on click with the id `restoreHideTickets`.
